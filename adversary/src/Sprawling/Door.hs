-- | What the door said.
--
-- 'Quiet' is a third outcome and deliberately not a synonym for acceptance.
-- The door prints what arrives before the city has been silent for a window,
-- so a command still being served looks exactly like a command that produced
-- nothing. Collapsing the two is how a refused action gets read as a
-- successful one; adversary-SPEC section 4 records the measurement that found
-- this.
data Answer
  = Accepted [Frame]
  | Denied Complaint
  | Quiet
  deriving stock (Eq, Show)

-- | How long the door waits for the city to go silent.
--
-- The client returns only after this much silence, so the window is paid in
-- full by every single action — the first draft set it above the product's
-- longest synchronous path (`PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`, 15 s) and thereby charged
-- thirty seconds for a query that answers in one millisecond.
--
-- What makes a short window honest is that no verb this adversary drives touches
-- a slow path: the model never attaches an endpoint, and every command it
-- sends is answered off local disk over loopback. 'Quiet' therefore means
-- "this city did not answer promptly", and the slow path's own hazard is
-- asserted by 'Sprawling.Model' having no action that walks it rather than by
-- waiting for one.
--
-- Measured rather than guessed: every command the model sends answered inside
-- one millisecond on the machine this was written on, so 250 ms is three
-- orders of margin and still two hundredths of the first draft's cost.
