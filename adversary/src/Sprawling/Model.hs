-- | What has to hold between what a city was told and what it will admit.
--
-- The model remembers only what a person would remember: which buildings
-- stand, what is halted, and whether any provider has ever been attached. It
-- never predicts a sequence number, a chain hash, a timestamp or an
-- `IdemKey` — those are rules, they already have an authority in Rust, and
-- restating one here is how a second authority begins.
--
-- What it does assert is which failure a caller sees. A stable code is part of
-- the door's contract rather than a derived value, so pinning it pins the
-- promise the product makes to the agent on the other side.

-- | The refusal the model says a caller must see, if any.

-- The order of the guards is the order the program checks in, and getting it
-- wrong would not weaken the property — it would make the adversary demand a
-- different failure than the one the caller is entitled to. Two orderings are
-- load-bearing and are the reason this function is written as a chain rather
-- than as a set of independent tests:
--
--   * A halted city answers "halted", not "no model is chosen". Swapping them
--     would send a person to attach a provider when what stopped their work
--     was a halt they can lift — and the recovery line is the third part of
--     what `AxError` promises.
--   * A reserved address is refused for being reserved before it is refused
--     for being occupied, because nothing may occupy it in the first place.
--   * For work, the halt outranks the address as well. This one is written
--     from measurement rather than from taste: the first draft assumed a
--     malformed address is judged first, and a halted city asked for work at
--     `.sprawling/books` answers `E_GATE_DENIED`. The product is consistent
--     about it — the same address under no halt answers `E_INVALID_ARGS`, and
--     `create_building` at a reserved address answers `E_INVALID_ARGS` even
--     while the city is halted, because laying out a building is not work and
--     the halt does not cover it.
