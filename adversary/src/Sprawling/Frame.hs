-- | The algebraic mirror of what a socket carries, and nothing else.
--
-- This module parses and does not judge. It knows the five frame classes
-- `channels::ServerFrame` spells and the shape of a refusal; it does not know
-- which refusal is owed, which is "Sprawling.Model"'s business.
--
-- An answer keeps its name and its body as it arrived. Fifteen queries exist
-- and the model drives four, so decoding all fifteen into records would be
-- fifteen restatements of a shape that already has an authority in Rust. The
-- name is checked because a renamed answer is a wire change; the body is read
-- only where something asserts on it.
