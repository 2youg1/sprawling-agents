-- | What this adversary delivers: a Rust test.
--
-- A counterexample that stays in Haskell is knowledge this repository does not
-- have. Rendering it as a test beside the code it accuses moves the knowledge
-- into the language that ships, and leaves nothing here that could grow into a
-- second authority.
--
-- The emitted test enters by the door `channels::server` uses —
-- `assembly::RunWorker::handle` — rather than by a socket. The adversary attacks
-- the binary over the wire because that is where an agent stands; the
-- regression it hands back runs in-process because a committed test should not
-- need a port, and the policy under accusation is the same on both paths.
--
-- The output has to survive `cargo fmt --check`, so this module agrees with
-- rustfmt rather than merely producing valid Rust.
