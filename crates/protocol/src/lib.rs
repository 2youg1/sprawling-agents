//! Two protocols, pointing opposite ways: `mcp` lets a resident reach an
//! outside service, `acp` lets an outside editor ask this city for work.
//!
//! The asymmetry is the design. Reaching out is something a resident
//! chose and the egress gate can refuse; reaching in is something a
//! stranger did, so it produces nothing until it has been authenticated
//! and reduced to an ordinary dispatch.
