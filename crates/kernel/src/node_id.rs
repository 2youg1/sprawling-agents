//! A plan node's address: the dotted path that says where it hangs.
//!
//! **A value, and that is why it is not in `kernel::plan`.** The tree
//! decides — what may be started, what a branch is worth, which of the
//! two exits a held node takes. This only says what a well-formed
//! address is, and refuses everything else at the one construction
//! point, so nothing downstream has to ask again. `plan` is shape 1;
//! this is shape 2 (ARCHITECTURE.md section 9).
//!
//! The hand-written `Deserialize` is the load-bearing part. A derived
//! one would accept any string off the wire and hand back a `NodeId`
//! that never passed `parse`, which is the whole of what this type is
//! for.
