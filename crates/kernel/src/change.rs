//! What moved between two checkpoints, as a fact rather than as a patch.
//!
//! Here rather than beside the git call that produces it, for the reason
//! `Restoration` is here: three places need this shape — `memory` reads
//! it off two trees, `channels` carries it, and the interface draws it —
//! and `channels` cannot see `memory`. Defining it twice and converting
//! between the copies would be two definitions of what a file change is,
//! and the one that drifts is always the one nobody is looking at.
//!
//! Paths and counts only. Patch text is file content, and file content
//! leaving this machine is the question `secret::scan` exists to answer;
//! a hunk therefore has to be asked for on its own and scanned like
//! anything else, which is why no field here can hold one.
