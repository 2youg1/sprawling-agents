//! How much of the whole plan one node is, and why nobody can mint more.
//! The part `crates/kernel/spec/Share.lean` specifies this module.
//!
//! A share exists in exactly two ways: it is the whole plan, or it is
//! one part of a share that was divided. [`Share::split`] takes its
//! input by value and hands back parts that add up to it exactly, so
//! **conservation is not a rule that is checked — it is the only thing
//! the type can express.** There is no constructor, no arithmetic, and
//! no `Deserialize`: a number read off a file cannot become a share
//! without being divided out of the whole first.
//!
//! That is what settles the estimation problem. A resident that splits
//! its own branch chooses how its own share is divided and cannot reach
//! past it, so an over-eager estimate costs its neighbours nothing and
//! the total stays 1. Capping replaces refereeing.
//!
//! Billionths rather than a fraction: two shares compare and add the
//! same way on every machine, repeated division never grows a
//! denominator, and no float ever touches a decision path
//! (ARCHITECTURE.md section 10 rule 6).
