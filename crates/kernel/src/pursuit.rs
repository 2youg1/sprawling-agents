//! A pursuit: a goal the city keeps working towards, and the one
//! condition under which a city that holds one stops.
//!
//! The construction plan called this Endless. It is named for what it
//! is rather than for how long it lasts, because three other things in
//! this repository are already called standing something.
//!
//! **A society does not stop because somebody shouts stop. It stops
//! because there is nothing ready to do.** That is the whole criterion:
//! the ready set is empty and no run is still going. Both halves are
//! needed — an empty ready set while four runs are working means the
//! work is in somebody's hands, not that it is finished.
//!
//! Money is deliberately not a criterion. The cost surface in this city
//! is material an agent optimises against, not a brake somebody pulls,
//! and a stop condition that read a budget would answer a question
//! nobody here asked.
//!
//! **A pursuit is the person's, and a delegate cannot declare
//! one.** [`Pursuit::declare`] takes the depth-zero position by
//! reference, and a `Delegate` value has no way to produce one — the
//! same two-layer guard `crate::delegation` uses, for the same reason:
//! a sub-agent that could set the city working until it runs out of work
//! is a sub-agent that can spend the night on its own idea.
//!
//! Pausing and clearing are different actions and both exist. Pause
//! keeps the goal and stops taking work; clearing is dropping the value,
//! so a cleared goal leaves nothing behind to be resumed by accident.
//! Cancelling a *run* is a third thing again, and it lives where runs do.
