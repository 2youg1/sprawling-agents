//! Repair leases: when the environment itself is
//! broken, repair is serialized — one live lease per scope subtree, so
//! two runs can never "fix" the same breakage into a bigger one. The
//! active table is the caller's state; kernel only judges.
//! The part `crates/kernel/spec/Repair.lean` specifies this module.
