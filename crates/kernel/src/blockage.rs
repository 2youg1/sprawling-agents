//! Red, and how far it reaches.
//! The part `crates/kernel/spec/Blockage.lean` specifies this module.
//!
//! **Red is not a new mechanism.** Every source of it is a fact the city
//! already records — a run that froze without citing anything, a door
//! that has waited too long for a person, `crate::stall` finding a run
//! going nowhere, or a resident saying in as many words that it is
//! stuck. This module answers the one question those facts do not: given
//! that `2.3.1` is red, what else in the plan cannot move?
//!
//! **The answer names the source, not the symptom.** A plan with one
//! real problem produces one blockage that says which node it is and
//! which nodes are waiting behind it, rather than seventeen red dots a
//! person has to trace back by hand. That is the whole reason to
//! propagate at all: the first screen has room for a cause, not for a
//! list of consequences.
//!
//! Red travels two ways, and both are the same relation seen from two
//! sides: **up the tree**, because a branch whose child is stuck is
//! stuck, and **along the dependency edges**, because a node that waits
//! for a red node waits for something that is not coming. Nothing here
//! reads a clock or a disk; the caller supplies the facts and gets a
//! verdict.
