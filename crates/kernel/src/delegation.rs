//! Delegation: two delegate kinds, one level deep.
//! The guard is two-layered on purpose: statically, a `Delegate` value
//! has no delegate method — minting a grandchild cannot be spelled;
//! dynamically, `admit` re-checks depth at every spawn so a hand-rolled
//! path cannot sneak past the type. One level is an invariant, not a
//! constant — a constant would imply it is tunable.
