//! Every judgement the process boundary makes, as pure functions with
//! exhaustive verdicts.
//!
//! Four questions, asked in four different places and answered here:
//! may this address be bound at all, may this peer put a credential in
//! the vault, may this peer's opening frame be accepted, and what does
//! a frame mean in the state the session is in. None of them touches a
//! socket, a clock or a file, so all four are tested by calling them.
//!
//! **This is the thick half of the Humble Object** the listener is
//! built as (ARCHITECTURE section 9). `channels::server` is declared an
//! adapter — "thin, no policy" — and policy is what these functions
//! are; a shell that also holds the rules it applies has no way to show
//! that it applies all of them. Every branch left in the shell is a
//! send, a receive, or the end of a session.
//!
//! Binding is loopback by default. Exposing the port demands a pairing
//! token, and a missing token refuses the *start*, not the connection:
//! "data stays on your team" is a judgement or it is decoration.
