//! The control surface: which frames intervene in work already running, and
//! what an intervention owes when it does.
//!
//! A human's Steer arrives here, not through an Inbox;
//! an Agent's Steer arrives as a high-priority Signal. Both land in the same
//! place - the result envelope - so the model only ever learns one shape.
//!
//! This module decides and returns; it holds no Ledger handle and writes
//! nothing. The obligation it reports is discharged by the assembly layer,
//! and the closing card asserts the obligation was met.
