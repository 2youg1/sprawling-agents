//! Watching several cities from one interface.
//!
//! One machine, one City, one Ledger. Two cities never
//! share a history, because a shared history would need distributed
//! ordering - and that trades a single writer's simple fact for a new class
//! of failure. What the interface may do is *look* at several at once.
//!
//! The hard constraint is one sentence, and it has a shape here rather
//! than a rule somewhere: **the aggregation layer forwards Queries and Events and never
//! forwards a Command.** Changing anything in another city means connecting
//! to that city directly, authenticating with its token, and writing to its
//! Ledger. An aggregator that could relay commands would be a cross-city
//! authority appearing on nobody's books - the target city could not tie
//! the command back to a person, and `PutSecret` refuses the trip anyway.
//!
//! That rule is not a check in this file. There is no method here that
//! accepts a Command, so relaying one has no spelling.
