//! Names of things this crate does not own, on their way through it.
//!
//! A mode, a provider, a template, an upload handle: each arrives as
//! text and leaves as a type that cannot be empty and cannot carry a
//! control character. That is the whole of what this crate may judge.
//!
//! **The legal value set stays upstream.** `runtime::Mode` owns which
//! modes exist, `gateway` owns which providers do, `city` owns the
//! templates; a closed list here would be a second authority that goes
//! stale the moment either side adds one. So an unknown value is not an
//! error at this boundary — it is an error where the authority is, and
//! it says so with the name in hand.
//!
//! One macro rather than four hand-written newtypes: the four differ in
//! their name and their doc line and in nothing else, and writing the
//! same constructor four times is four places for it to drift.
