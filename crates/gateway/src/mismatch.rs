//! Reading a value out of a provider's JSON, and the one word for what
//! it means when the shape is not the one this build asked for.
//!
//! Both dialects need the same four readers and fail the same way, so
//! the readers and the failure live together and each dialect module
//! depends on this one rather than on the other. Every accessor takes
//! the path it is reading, because "expected string" without a path
//! sends a person to read a whole response body to find the field.
//!
//! `E_WIRE_MISMATCH` is a loadtime code: what it means is that the
//! endpoint's declared dialect does not match what answered it, so the
//! recovery says exactly that rather than "try again".
