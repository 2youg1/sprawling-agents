//! The development loop: change something, look at it, decide whether to
//! look again.
//!
//! The decision is here and the waiting is not. What this module answers
//! is "given what the last look showed, what now" — a pure question with
//! an exhaustive answer, so a loop that would never end is a thing the
//! type system can be asked about rather than a thing somebody notices
//! at three in the morning.
