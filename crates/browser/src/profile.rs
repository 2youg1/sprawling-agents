//! Where a browser keeps what it remembers, and who that belongs to.
//!
//! Login state belongs to a Building, not to the city and not to a run.
//! A building is one project with one set of accounts; two buildings
//! sharing a profile would let a run reach an account nobody granted it,
//! and the reach would be invisible because nothing was passed.
//!
//! A confidential building keeps nothing at all. The point of that mark
//! is that what happens inside it leaves no trace outside the run, and a
//! cookie jar is a trace that outlives every run that wrote to it.
