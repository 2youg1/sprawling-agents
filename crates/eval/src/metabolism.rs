//! Accumulation without metabolism is debt: every settled asset costs
//! resident bytes in the prompts that disclose it, disk in every export,
//! and attention in every list it appears in. So the city has a cycle
//! that says what stops being carried.
//!
//! Two rules keep this from being destructive. **Nothing is deleted** —
//! the strongest verdict is `Retire`, which stops an asset being
//! disclosed and leaves it exactly where it is; the Discard register is
//! the only thing that removes anything, and it is reversible by
//! construction. And **the reason travels with the verdict**, because a
//! list of things that vanished with no explanation teaches people to
//! stop trusting the cycle that vanished them.
