//! A versioned probe: the same questions, asked twice, to see whether
//! something survived a boundary.
//!
//! The first object is the Handoff, and the shape comes from what that
//! has to prove: ask before the freeze, ask after the resume, compare.
//! If the answers differ, the handoff lost something, and the probe says
//! which question lost it rather than reporting a score.
//!
//! **Probes are versioned and results never mix across versions.** A
//! probe whose questions changed is a different instrument, and
//! comparing its readings with the old one measures the instrument. The
//! comparison refuses it rather than averaging it away.
