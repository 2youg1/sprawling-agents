//! What changed between two checkpoints, as paths and counts.
//!
//! The write side of this city has been git-native since S3.07 — every
//! tool wave is fenced by a real commit — and nothing anywhere could read
//! two of those commits back and say what moved between them. This is
//! that read.
//!
//! **The scope is already right, and it is right for free.** A checkpoint
//! stages `<scope>/*` and nothing wider, so the difference between two of
//! them cannot contain a file the Run merely read. Other harnesses report
//! a session diff that includes everything the session opened, and their
//! users cannot tell what the agent actually wrote; the fence being the
//! write domain is what spares this one that.
//!
//! **Counts, never patch text.** `checkpoint::scan_staged` refuses to
//! echo the bytes that matched a secret shape, because printing them to
//! prove a leak is the leak. Patch text is file content on a socket, and
//! that is the same question — so a hunk has to be its own request,
//! answered through the same scan, and it is not this module.
