//! The production `Vfs`: `std::fs`, with one piece of state.
//!
//! Zero policy. Every method is the std call the trait names, and the
//! one thing this adapter remembers — the handle on the file it is
//! appending to — exists because opening a file costs a syscall per
//! call rather than per byte, and a ledger appends to one segment over
//! and over.
