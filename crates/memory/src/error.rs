//! What this crate's twelve modules say when persistence refuses, and
//! the one door that turns it into an `AxError`.
//!
//! **Why this is a module of its own.** memory-SPEC 7 recorded
//! the condition when the type was born: it lived beside the ledger
//! while fewer than three modules aggregated here, and moved out at
//! three. Twelve modules import it today, and nine of its twenty
//! variants describe failures the ledger cannot produce — a corrupt CAS
//! object, a projection that will not open, a worktree that is behind
//! the trunk. Executing a decision whose stated condition has arrived
//! needs no new argument.
//!
//! One rule holds the type together: **a variant carries the operation,
//! the subject and the recovery, and never the bytes**. `SecretEgress`
//! is where that is load-bearing — proving a credential leaked by
//! reprinting it would be the leak.
