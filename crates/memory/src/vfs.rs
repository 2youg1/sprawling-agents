//! The filesystem seam this crate reaches disk through, and nothing else.
//!
//! One trait, two adapters: [`crate::real_fs::RealFs`] over `std::fs` in
//! production, and `FaultFs` (S1.08) over a deterministic power-loss
//! model. The second adapter is what makes this a seam rather than a
//! layer of indirection — a power cut is a property of filesystem
//! semantics, so it is injected here and every module above stays free
//! of test hooks (memory-SPEC 8.5, design A).
//!
//! **The seam stays inner.** `Vfs` is `pub(crate)`: `JsonlLedger` holds
//! a `Box<dyn Vfs>` and never names it in a public signature, because a
//! private trait in a public signature does not compile (E0445) and
//! because what a city stores its history on is not a decision this
//! crate delegates outward.
