//! The attention-cost acceptance, as assertions rather than as a review.
//!
//! Four promises are made about this interface: it does not keep a count
//! of things you have not looked at, it does not scroll forever, its
//! progress bar does not move on its own, and a tab in the background
//! stops. Each of them is checkable, and a promise that is only checked
//! by somebody remembering to look is a promise that lasts until the
//! first busy week.
