//! Where a point on the city's ground lands on the screen.
//!
//! One geometry, used by everything that draws and by everything that
//! picks: the browser hit-tests the very polygons this produced, so
//! "what is drawn is what can be picked" is the construction rather than
//! an assertion.
//!
//! Integer arithmetic throughout, and every operation saturating. The
//! picture must be identical on every machine that draws it, which is
//! what makes a display-list comparison a real test of the view.
//!
//! What this module does not know is what a building is. It projects
//! points, fits a window around what was drawn, and spells a polygon;
//! `web::skyline` is what turns a city into the prisms it projects.
