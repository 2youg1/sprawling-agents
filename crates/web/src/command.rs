//! Every command frame this client sends, built in one place.
//!
//! **Why they are together.** A frame constructor is where a control
//! stops being a picture and becomes a verb on the wire, and
//! `xtask wiring` judges exactly that crossing: a verb the city can carry
//! out must be reachable from here, and one it cannot must not be. With
//! the constructors scattered through the views, "does anything send
//! this" was a question you answered by grepping and hoping.
//!
//! Each takes what the control knows and nothing else. The idempotency
//! key is derived from a fixed phrase per verb rather than from a clock,
//! because a client has no clock this city trusts - the one sampling
//! point is `bin::assembly` (ARCHITECTURE.md section 10).
