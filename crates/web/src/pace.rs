//! How often this page may change, and what a burst of frames folds into
//! before it changes.
//!
//! **The defect this exists for.** `App::connect` applied every frame the
//! moment it arrived: one message wrote the snapshot, wrote the held
//! records, and re-rendered the whole tree. A run does not deliver events
//! one at a time - a single tool wave writes `tool_called`, `gate_checked`,
//! `checkpoint_committed`, `tool_result` and often `result_offloaded`
//! within a few milliseconds, and each of them repainted a page holding up
//! to `HELD_RECORDS` rows. The work was real and none of it was visible: a
//! display cannot show more than one frame per refresh, so the paints in
//! between were produced for nobody.
//!
//! **The rule is therefore about the display, not about performance.** A
//! page may change once per frame. Everything that arrives between two
//! frames is one change, and this module decides what that one change is.
//!
//! **Batched, never merged.** Events are facts and the fold that consumes
//! them is forward-only, so all of them are applied, in arrival order, and
//! none is dropped - the saving is one write and one paint instead of *n*.
//! Answers are different in kind: an answer is the current state of
//! something, so two answers to the same question are not two facts but one
//! fact and one stale copy. Painting the stale one on the way to the
//! current one is exactly the flicker this module removes.
//!
//! **A refusal is kept, and only the last one.** The client already holds
//! one refusal at a time (`web::alert` records why: a refusal is an answer
//! to an action, not a fact in the history, and two attempts deserve two
//! answers). Within a single frame the second answer is the one that
//! belongs to the most recent attempt.
