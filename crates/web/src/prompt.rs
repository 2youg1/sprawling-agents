//! What one run was given: the four frozen blocks of its prompt, and the
//! skills it was admitted (v0.0.3 cards V3.26 and V3.27).
//!
//! **Most harnesses cannot answer this.** Their prompt is a string built
//! at the moment of calling, and once the call returns there is nothing
//! left to look at. Here the prefix is frozen at run start, split into
//! four blocks whose order is the cache economics, and the assembly is
//! itself a ledger line carrying each block's hash and length. So "what
//! exactly went to the model this turn" is a question with a recorded
//! answer, and this page is that answer read back rather than a second
//! computation of it.
//!
//! **Nothing here is recomputed.** Every figure is lifted out of a
//! record this client already folds; a page that hashed the blocks again
//! would be a second authority on what the run was given, and the only
//! interesting case is the one where the two disagree.
//!
//! **A skill is compared against the last time this city looked.** The
//! shelf is hashed when it is read and the hash rides in `run_started`,
//! so an earlier run's line is a reading taken at an earlier time. A
//! document that keeps its name and changes its bytes is what an
//! injection looks like, and it is invisible to everything else in this
//! interface. The comparison is against this city's own history, not
//! against a signature: it says *this changed*, never *this is safe*.
