//! Cost, savings, and the machine's own vital signs.
//!
//! **Series are told apart without hue.** Width, dash pattern and end marker
//! carry the distinction; at most four series to a chart; each line labelled
//! at its end rather than in a legend. A legend asks the reader to hold a
//! mapping in their head while looking somewhere else.
//!
//! **The layout is anti-attention.** Normal rows fold to a single line;
//! abnormal ones rise to the top and open. No red dots, no unread counts, no
//! infinite stream - all three manufacture returns to the screen without
//! adding information.
//!
//! **The cost page never advises.** It orders facts. Whether a SKILL earns
//! the bytes it occupies needs something the interface does not have -
//! whether it will still be used next quarter - so the ranking is the
//! deliverable and the judgement stays with the person.
//!
//! Machine metrics live here and go no further: not into `status`, not into
//! any prefix. A model's decisions do not use resident memory or link rate,
//! and putting them in context would charge every turn for a report nobody
//! reads.
