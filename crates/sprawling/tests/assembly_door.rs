//! The door the wire uses, entered from outside the crate.
//!
//! A served city reaches its assembly point one way: `wire::server`
//! hands a `Command` to `RunWorker::handle`. Nothing in this repository
//! could do the same, because the crate had no lib target and the
//! assembly point was a private module of a binary — so the widest
//! concentration of policy here was reachable only from tests sitting in
//! the same file. This enters by the production door and asserts on the
//! Ledger, which is the city's only history.
