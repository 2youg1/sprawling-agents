//! What a run's desks left behind: the lines the history takes, and the
//! change the city may not make before them.
//!
//! `docs/glossary.md` defines the Ledger as the only history, and says
//! every effect becomes an EventRecord first. ARCHITECTURE.md section 5
//! calls that ordering the design's load-bearing rule rather than a
//! logging preference. It used to be spelled out once per desk inside
//! `dispatch_in`, and two of the six spelled it backwards - the shared
//! plan was written and the shelf was filed before the lines that
//! announce them.
//!
//! Here the order is a property of the types instead. [`Then`] - the
//! change - is reachable only out of [`Landing::record`], and that
//! method appends every line before it hands the change over. Writing
//! the other order means obtaining a value that has no other source.
