//! What guards the door one serve opens (sprawling-SPEC.md section
//! 8-22).
//!
//! Pure, and pure on purpose: the entropy a minted key is made of is
//! drawn in `bin::assembly`, which is where this crate draws randomness,
//! and `wire::auth` documents that arrangement from the other side
//! ("Entropy arrives as a parameter. This module samples nothing").
//! What is left here is the policy, which is four cells over two facts
//! and therefore something a test can state in full.
//!
//! This decides only where a key comes from. Whether the listener may
//! bind at all stays with `wire::decide_bind`, and nothing here
//! weakens it: the assembly layer satisfies that guard before the socket
//! exists rather than moving it.
