//! Main's assembly point — the dirtiest component and the only
//! omniscient one: it knows every concrete type, and nothing knows it.
//! Ledger handle, clock source, RNG seed and spawn points are injected
//! from here and nowhere else; citysim is the second Main.
//!
//! The clock is sampled *here only* (determinism rule 2): every callee
//! takes time as a parameter, and the sample stays in this file so that
//! the rule keeps naming one place.
//!
//! **This file holds the worker and the modules below hold its methods.**
//! `RunWorker` is declared here, so its twenty-two private fields are
//! visible throughout `assembly` and nowhere else — a private item
//! reaches the module that declares it and that module's descendants, so
//! the split cost no field its privacy. What stays here is what every
//! submodule needs and no submodule owns: the worker itself, the one
//! clock sample, the record it appends, the two hooks a live control
//! surface installs, and the door a `Command` enters by.
//!
//! The `use` block below is the one place the sixteen submodules see
//! each other through. A submodule imports from `super`, never from a
//! sibling, so what one part of the assembly point offers another is
//! stated once, here, and reads as a list rather than as a graph.
