//! An MCP server run as a child process, spoken to one line at a time.
//!
//! The protocol crate knows what to say; this module knows where the
//! bytes go, how long they may take, and who reclaims the process. All
//! three belong to the assembly layer, because they are the parts that
//! touch this machine.
//!
//! Two decisions are worth reading before changing anything here.
//!
//! **The reader is a thread, and the deadline is real.** A synchronous
//! read on a pipe has no deadline of its own, so a server that never
//! answers would hold the run's only worker forever — the exact failure
//! this project has already met once from the other direction, when a
//! provider went silent after `model_called` and nothing timed out. The
//! thread turns a blocking read into a channel this side can wait on
//! with a deadline. It cannot leak: killing the child closes the pipe,
//! the reader sees end of input, and it returns.
//!
//! **A deadline that passes kills the child.** A late answer arriving
//! after its call gave up would be read as the answer to the next call,
//! and two calls swapped is worse than a refusal. Killing ends that
//! possibility rather than guarding against it.
