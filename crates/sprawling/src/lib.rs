//! The city harness as a library, so that the assembly point has a door
//! somebody outside this crate can enter (sprawling-SPEC.md section 8-15).
//!
//! Two of the binary's modules stay with the binary rather than here:
//! `install` puts this executable where a shell will find it, and
//! `wire_client` talks to a served city from a terminal. Both are about
//! the command line rather than about a city, and neither has a second
//! caller.
//!
//! What is `pub` is decided per item, never per module. A module is
//! `pub` so that `bin::assembly` keeps the name ARCHITECTURE.md section
//! 12 gives it; the items inside stay `pub(crate)` unless the binary or
//! an integration test enters through them, and `cargo xtask apisync`
//! holds the result against `xtask/api-baselines/sprawling.txt`.
