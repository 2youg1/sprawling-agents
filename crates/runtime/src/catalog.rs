//! Progressive disclosure: L2 tools, reading-room
//! SKILL entries and the current mode, one line each in the Resident
//! segment, expansions on demand. Only what this session can actually
//! reach is listed — admission is the caller's evidence (city::policy
//! evaluates reading rooms in P1; until then the assembler supplies the

//!
//! `tool_defs` is the single source of `ChatRequest.tools`: a tool absent
//! here does not exist for the model.
