//! Run modes. A run sits in exactly one mode; the
//! catalog lists only that one (progressive disclosure — the other modes'
//! semantics stay out of the window).
//!
//! One exception, and it is one line long: [`change_modes_line`] names
//! the self-change modes a run is *not* in. Without it an agent working
//! in this city never learns that the city's own code and SPECs are
//! changeable at all, or under what discipline — and a capability nobody
//! is told about is one nobody uses.
//!
//! P3 adds the half that decides: [`admits`] says whether what a run
//! produced may land, given the mode it was in. The evidence arrives as
//! plain answers rather than as an `eval` type, because that crate sits
//! outside this one and the question here is not how evidence was
//! gathered but whether enough of it exists.
