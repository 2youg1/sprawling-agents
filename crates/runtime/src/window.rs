//! The run's conversation history: the volatile half of a request.
//!
//! Frozen-prefix bytes never live here. What does is every message the
//! run has exchanged since it started, folded forward turn by turn by
//! the executor that owns it, and handed to the model beneath the
//! prefix on each call.
//!
//! **One invariant, enforced at every entrance**: consecutive user
//! content joins the message already open rather than opening a second
//! one. A steer, a tool result and the opening task are three doors into
//! the same rule, so none of them can produce the alternating shape a
//! provider refuses.
