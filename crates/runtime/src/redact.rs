//! What a model said, on its way into history.
//!
//! Everything a provider sends back becomes a ledger payload verbatim,
//! and a model that read a key can repeat one. The ledger is permanent
//! and exportable, so it is the sink that matters: a secret there
//! outlives the session, the machine and the person's memory of it.
//!
//! Two decisions carry this module.
//!
//! **The window keeps the bytes; the ledger does not.** The blocks the
//! next request is built from are extracted before this runs, so
//! redacting here cannot break a thinking block's signature or make the
//! conversation stop making sense. History and context are two sinks
//! with two different requirements, and only one of them is forever.
//!
//! **The replacement is a marker, not a vault entry.** A key the model
//! echoed is not a credential the city was asked to keep; storing it
//! would give it a life nobody asked for, and inventing a realm for it
//! would put a made-up name in the vault's namespace. The marker carries
//! the first sixteen hex of the content hash instead, which is enough to
//! see that two occurrences are the same value and never enough to be
//! one.
