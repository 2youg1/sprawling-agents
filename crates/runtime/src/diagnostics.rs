//! The diagnostic log: write-only, five levels, three required fields.
//! The design this implements is `docs/logging.md`.
//!
//! **Decision and recovery logic reads no log output.** That rule is held
//! by shape rather than by discipline: this surface has write methods and
//! no read method, so reading a line back inside the code cannot be
//! spelled. The consequence is the one the design cares about — deleting
//! every log leaves behaviour, replay and totals byte-identical, because
//! nothing downstream could have depended on them.
//!
//! A line carries `seq` and never a timestamp. The Ledger position is
//! what anchors a log line to the only history, and it is an integer
//! two timelines can be lined up on; a wall clock sampled here would
//! also be a second sampling point in a library that is not allowed one.
//! A sink that wants a clock is free to add one — the assembly layer is
//! where sampling is sanctioned.
//!
//! A sink receives an [`Entry`] rather than a rendered line, because a
//! sink that had to read the fields back out of the text would be a
//! second authority on what a line is made of. [`render`] is the one
//! way text is produced, and a sink that wants text calls it.
