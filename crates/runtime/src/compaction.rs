//! When to shorten something, and what to keep.
//!
//! The mechanism half of this — moving a big result out of the window
//! and leaving a reference — is `offload`'s and was frozen first. This
//! is the policy half: given a piece of text, what kind of thing is it,
//! and which end of it carries the information.
//!
//! Three rules hold the whole module up.
//!
//! **The result is never longer than the input.** Shortening that
//! lengthens is not a corner case, it is the failure that makes a
//! context budget meaningless, so it is an invariant with a test rather
//! than a property people remember.
//!
//! **No regular expressions on this path.** Detection is a handful of
//! prefix and count checks over the first few lines; a pattern engine
//! here would put backtracking between a model and its next turn.
//!
//! **Cuts land on character boundaries.** A budget in bytes and a cut in
//! the middle of a character is how a compactor produces text nothing
//! downstream can read.
