//! What the city is listening to, and which building answers.
//!
//! The shape is `schedule`'s: a table on disk, a pure question over it,
//! and dispatches as the answer. The difference is where the trigger
//! comes from. A schedule fires because time passed, which the city can
//! observe on its own; a watch fires because something happened
//! elsewhere, which it cannot.
//!
//! So the city does not ask. Polling would be a timer nobody reads,
//! running whether or not anything happened, and it would be a second
//! authority on what arrived first. The service that holds the
//! connection pushes, and this module only decides where a push lands.
//!
//! A building that no longer exists is no longer listening. A building
//! is one line of business; when the line ends the building goes, and
//! its subscriptions go with it rather than needing a second list
//! somebody has to remember to prune.
//!
//! Specified by `crates/city/spec/Watch.lean` §8-7.
