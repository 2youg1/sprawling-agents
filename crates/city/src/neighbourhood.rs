//! Who a run can reach, and who stands there (city-SPEC.md section
//! 8-15).
//!
//! This building has speech and had no address book. `signal` takes the
//! address of whoever you are talking to, the refusal names the boundary
//! rather than the residents inside it, and delivery opens a queue for
//! whatever address it is given - so a guessed name returned
//! `queued: true` and was read by nobody. What is scanned here is the
//! answer to the question that guess was standing in for.
//!
//! **Detail decays with distance.** This building's addresses come with
//! the line each resident wrote about what to bring them; the rest of
//! the city comes as building names and nothing else. That is not a new
//! rule - it is the boundary `signal` already draws, made visible, so
//! that what a run can see and what it can say to are the same set.
