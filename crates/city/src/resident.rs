//! Standing identity. A resident is an address plus the file that says
//! how it works, and that file is the resident segment of every prefix it
//! runs under — so two residents with different URBANITE files solve the
//! same task differently, which is the point rather than a defect.
//!
//! The dossier is a projection, not a second file: what a resident has
//! done is already in the ledger, and a stored summary beside it would be
//! a second account of the same past.
