//! Which room a named session works in, and how a new one comes into
//! being (city-SPEC.md section 8-13).
//!
//! A room is where one session keeps its files, which is what
//! `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 6 has always said of `JOB.md`. What was
//! missing is that nothing opened a room for a session that did not name
//! one, so every dispatch a person typed by hand landed in the same
//! address and the second one wrote over the first one's work.

/// are not rooms (that is what keeps the reserved subtree out), and
/// neither is the archive, which is where a building keeps what it
