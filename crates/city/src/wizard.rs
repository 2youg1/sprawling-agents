//! Starting a city, and moving a resident inside one.
//!
//! Both are decisions rather than actions. What a new city consists of
//! and what a move implies are answered here as values; making the
//! directories and writing the events is the binary's work. That split
//! is what lets "one instruction builds a city" be tested without
//! building one.
//!
//! A move is the harder of the two, and the reason is that an address
//! decides three things at once: where the resident may write, what it
//! reads by default, and who it reports to. Moving is therefore never a
//! rename — it is a new write domain, and the history stays where it
//! happened. A city that rewrote history to match a new address would be
//! a city where "this is where it was done" has no answer.
