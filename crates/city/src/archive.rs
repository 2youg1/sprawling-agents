//! What a building remembers between runs.
//!
//! Four kinds, and the list is closed: a preference somebody stated, a
//! decision somebody made, a correction somebody had to make twice, and
//! a fact about the world that was expensive to find out. Anything that
//! does not fit one of those four is a note, and notes belong in the
//! documents a person already reads.
//!
//! **Recall is structural, not semantic.** An entry is filed by kind and
//! date, the index says where it is, and reading it means reading the
//! original. No vector store, no embedding, no similarity: the recall
//! this needs is "what did we decide about X", and an index answers that
//! without a second copy of the text to drift from the first.
//!
//! The index is a projection. Delete it and it rebuilds from the
//! entries, which is why it may be stored as plainly as it is.
