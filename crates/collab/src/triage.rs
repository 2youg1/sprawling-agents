//! Where something from outside lands.
//!
//! Everything that arrives — a person's sentence, a webhook, a signal
//! from another city — goes through here, and what comes out is always
//! an Address. That is the whole point: the dispatch surface has one
//! shape, and the only thing triage varies is how much machinery meets
//! the arrival.
//!
//! Rules are read before the reflex is chosen, because a rule is
//! somebody's decision and a reflex is a default. A rule that matches
//! settles both the address and the reflex; nothing matching is not an
//! error, it is the case where a person reads it.
