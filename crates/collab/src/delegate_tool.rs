//! The face delegation shows a model: ask for one piece of work to be
//! carried out by somebody else, one level down.
//!
//! Everything this tool decides was already decided elsewhere. Whether a
//! spawn is admitted is `kernel::gate::spawn`, which has held the rule
//! since S2 and had no caller in production until this file: **a
//! delegated position spawns nothing, whatever kind it asks for.** What
//! this module adds is the desk that remembers what was asked for, so
//! the assembly layer - the only thing that can build a run - can start
//! it when the parent's wave is over.
//!
//! **A request is not a run.** The tool answers with the room the work
//! will happen in, not with a result, because starting a run inside a
//! tool call would mean driving a run from inside another run's tool
//! bench. The city dispatches what this desk holds after the parent's
//! turn settles, and the child's own `run_started` carries that room -
//! which is how a reader connects the two without a second event kind
//! for a fact the ledger already holds twice.
