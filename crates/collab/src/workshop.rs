//! One creation split into nodes, and the order they run in.
//!
//! A node contract is the whole task authority for the agent that takes
//! the node: what to reach, what it may read at which version, where it
//! may write, how done is decided, and when to stop. Written to disk it
//! is that node's `JOB.md`, so the mechanism costs nothing in the prefix.
//!
//! Scheduling is deterministic because replay is: the same graph and the
//! same ledger must produce the same order, or a failure cannot be
//! reproduced. Ties are broken by node id, and every collection here is
//! ordered for that reason.
//!
//! The graph's authority is the building's `Roadmap.md`. This module
//! keeps no second store of what the plan is; it is handed contracts and
//! answers what may run.
