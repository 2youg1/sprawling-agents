//! The signal tool: the face `collab::inbox` shows a model.
//!
//! Two orderings carry the design. Sending only queues an effect — the
//! delivery happens after the drive returns and after the enqueue is in
//! the ledger, because a projection may only change as a consequence of
//! a record that already exists. And the room's inbox is *lent* to the
//! desk for the length of the run rather than copied into it: two
//! queues would be two authorities on what order signals arrive in, and
//! the one that drifts is always the one nobody reads.
//!
//! Reach is handed in, not worked out here. Which building an address
//! belongs to is `city`'s answer, and this crate cannot name that crate;
//! what it can do is refuse anything outside the boundary it was given.
