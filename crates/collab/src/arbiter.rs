//! Two goals want the same resource. Who decides, and how far up.
//!
//! Detection is `kernel::goal`'s and stays there; this module holds the
//! three levels and the way between them. The split is the point:
//! deciding *that* two goals clash is mechanical, deciding *what to do*
//! usually is not.
//!
//! Level one is serialisation: when the clash is mechanically decidable
//! (the same paths, one goal standing and one not), the later goal
//! waits, and no judgment is involved. Level two is an arbitration
//! agent: reading two goal statements and telling whether they really
//! conflict is reading, which is a model's work. Level three is the
//! person, and two things always reach it: anything touching intent, and
//! anything a gate refused. A machine does not overrule a gate, and a
//! machine that guessed at intent would be guessing at the thing the
//! person is here for.
