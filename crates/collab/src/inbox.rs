//! Signals between residents, and the side that receives them.
//!
//! Delivery is at-least-once, so the receiving side deduplicates by the
//! signal's own id, and it does so before anything that cannot be
//! replayed: a second delivery must not bill twice or send a second
//! letter. That deduplication is the queue's `seen` set rather than a
//! table kept here, which holds only while one id always lands in one
//! lane — so a signal's lane is derived from the signal, never chosen at
//! the call site.
//!
//! Taking is the receiver's move. A sender cannot push into another
//! agent's context window; the receiver pulls at most its own bandwidth,
//! and what stands in the prefix is nothing at all — only `status`
//! reports that signals are waiting.
