//! Where the branches come back together.
//!
//! Two rules hold this join. An unverified result is a claim, not an
//! artifact, and claims do not join: the only way to build an
//! [`Artifact`] is to verify a [`Claim`], and verification is somebody
//! other than the node's own agent saying the done check passed.
//!
//! The second rule is that the judge must have read what it is judging.
//! Before a verdict, the fan-in asks for an artifact's whole content and
//! checks it against the digest, so an answer can only come from having
//! opened it. A digest-derived answer would not do: the question has to
//! name the artifact's `cas:b3-…` locator, and that locator spells the
//! digest. This is a fence rather than a proof - one read is not
//! all reading - and the honest claim is the narrow one: a judgment
//! passed without opening anything is refused.
