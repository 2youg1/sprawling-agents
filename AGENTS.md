# AGENTS.md — how work is done in this repository

**For any agent or person about to change this code.** Read this file to the end before the first edit; it is short on purpose, and everything it does not cover is one link away.

sprawling is a locally deployed agent-city harness: one Rust binary, a WebAssembly client embedded inside it, and a city that keeps its whole history in one append-only Ledger. Most of it was written by models, and every rule below exists for one reason that applies to a person just as much: **a contributor who does not remember yesterday still has to produce work that holds.**

## The loop

```bash
cargo install just cargo-nextest --locked   # once; the toolchain installs itself from rust-toolchain.toml
just check                                  # fmt + clippy (-D warnings, --all-features) + nextest + every machine gate
```

**A change is finished when `just check` is green.** "I finished it" is a claim; a green run is the evidence.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just check` | the closing condition for every change |
| `just gates` | the machine gates alone |
| `just check-web` | clippy on the wasm target — the two places `just check` cannot reach |
| `just build-web` | build the client bundle, without `dx` |
| `just dist` | the whole deliverable: client, binary, bill of materials, size badges |
| `just sim [seed]` | citysim scenarios; a failure reproduces from its seed |
| `just spec <crate>` | generate a SPEC skeleton |
| `just api-baseline` | recompute the public-surface baselines |
| `just replay <log>` | verify a ledger chain offline, read-only |
| `just mem [pid]` / `just bench` / `just budget` | the measurements, in this platform's own vocabulary |
| `just fuzz <target>` / `just mutants` | fuzz targets / mutation testing |
| `just adversary` | the out-of-tree property checker that attacks the binary through the wire; never a gate, and a no-op without GHC |

## Read before you write

1. [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — what the code is made of, how the twelve crates are wired, what one dispatch does end to end. Its `depmap` block and module map are machine authorities.
2. The SPEC of the crate you are touching, `crates/<crate>/<crate>-SPEC.md` — the interfaces and decisions, written before the code.
3. [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) — one name per concept, enforced by a gate.
4. The tests next to the code you are about to change.

**Read the official documentation of a tool before you use it** — a language feature, a crate, a CLI, a framework. Load the vendor's own agent guide or skill when one exists. Two are hard requirements because both moved recently: the front end is **Dioxus** built without `dx` (<https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.7/>), and the wasm build needs a `wasm-bindgen` CLI whose version equals the crate version.

## One change, five steps

1. **Take one piece of work.** One session, one bounded change, read its context in full before starting.
2. **Write the SPEC first.** Interfaces and decisions land in the crate's SPEC before the code exists. A new module states which of the seven shapes it instantiates ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §9); when there is no answer, stop and ask rather than write. *(The view layer is exempt — see below.)*
3. **Red.** Write the failing test and **run it once to watch it fail**. That run is what proves the test can bite. *(The view layer is exempt.)*
4. **Green.** Implement until it passes, no more. When the implementation wants to differ from the SPEC, change the SPEC first.
5. **Close.** All four: `just check` green | the red-to-green transition visible in the commit order | SPEC and code in step | the module map updated.

When a session ends with the work unfinished, write what is left — where you got to, what blocked you, what comes next — into the SPEC section it belongs to, not into your own memory.

## The rules a machine holds

Violating any of these turns CI red with a message naming the rule, the violation, and an alternative.

| Write it this way | Held by |
|---|---|
| Return failure through `Result`. No `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!`, `unreachable!`, bare indexing or slicing in non-test code. Checked arithmetic; `TryFrom` for narrowing; no `as` casts; no `unsafe`. | workspace lints, `-D warnings` |
| One module, one file, semantically named. Register the file in the module map, then create it. Keep `lib.rs` and index files free of logic. | `xtask modmap` |
| Keep a function inside 200 lines and 4 parameters, and a file inside 400 lines, tests included (re-priced from 1000 on 2026-09-05; the register in `budgets.toml` is the backlog). Values that always travel together are one value: give them a name. What predates a rule is listed in the register, may only shrink, and is struck once it is no longer needed. | `xtask length` with `xtask/budgets.toml` |
| Default to `pub(crate)`. Declare a `pub` trait only in a file on the seam list. | `xtask depmap` |
| Start every `.rs` file with the MPL-2.0 notice, then the copyright line. | `xtask header` |
| Take the time as a parameter. The single sampling point is `bin::assembly`. | `clippy.toml` disallowed methods |
| Use `BTreeMap` on kernel decision paths; keep floats out of ledger payloads; start tasks from the one spawn point. | review, plus the citysim determinism scenarios |
| One name per concept, taken from the glossary. | `xtask lexicon` with `xtask/lexicon.toml` |
| Keep each crate's committed baseline equal to its live public surface — this is checked on every run. Move the crate's SPEC in the same change-set as a baseline edit — this is checked over a release range. | `xtask apisync` |
| Keep credentials as `secret:realm/name` references; let plaintext reach the vault only. | `xtask secret` |
| Take colour from `web::theme`; express a colour as a ratio of the gamut limit. | `xtask color` |
| Keep sizes inside their budget, and badges in step with the artifacts. | `xtask budget` |
| Describe every kernel enum in its SPEC table variant for variant. | `xtask specalign` |
| Give every verb the city can carry out a control that reaches it, or classify it on the wire seam and say why a person may not ask for it. | `xtask wiring` with `channels-SPEC.md` §19-2 |
| Take every word a reader is given from `web::lang`. | `xtask wording` |
| Offer in the client every role, accessible name and landmark a settled screen wrote down. | `xtask ax`, `xtask render` |
| Publish nothing that names one machine's home directory or its working notes. | `xtask release` |
| **Fix the cause when a gate goes red.** Loosening a gate *in the change that the gate is failing* requires an explicit ruling from the person, recorded as a `Verdict:` trailer. Re-pricing a rule in its own commit does not. | `xtask guard` |

The last row is the load-bearing one: it closes the single universal escape hatch, which is loosening a gate in order to pass it. It deliberately does **not** close the other door: a rule whose price has changed may be re-priced in a commit of its own, and doing so is ordinary work rather than an exception.

**What the machine decides is the pair.** It asks whether one commit changes gate machinery (`xtask/`, `.github/`, the root manifest, `deny.toml`, `clippy.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, the `justfile`, or a module-table row it removes) *and* changes the source those gates judge (`crates/`, `citysim/`, `fuzz/`). Both sides present without a trailer is the shortcut. One side alone is not: a gate change travelling by itself is the re-pricing the paragraph above protects, and product work touching no gate machinery never meets this rule at all.

**Every rule that excludes an architecture carries a re-pricing condition.** A rule that was right when it was written is not thereby right now; the parameter that made it right is written beside it, and when that parameter moves the rule is re-argued rather than obeyed. Rules that exclude a *defect* — the panic bans, the arithmetic bans, the determinism rules — carry no such condition, because nothing about them expires.

## The view layer is exempt from the ceremony

`crates/web` and the stylesheet it ships are **not** held to SPEC-first or to red-before-green. What makes an interface good is cheap iteration, and a process that charges a SPEC and a failing test for every visual change buys correctness the view layer was not losing while taxing the only thing it is short of.

The view layer is held to the machine rules that survive it: the panic bans, colour from `web::theme`, and the size budget. Its correctness is judged by looking at it in a browser, against the same stylesheet the product ships.

**What replaces the ceremony is a method, not nothing.** [`docs/frontend-method.md`](docs/frontend-method.md) is how a screen gets built here: settle it in HTML against the shipped stylesheet, translate it with `dx translate`, add only bindings, and accept it with `cargo xtask ax` and `cargo xtask render` — the first reads what both sides wrote down, the second opens the screen in a real engine and measures where its boxes landed. Read it before changing a screen — it also records the one defect the translator has, which you must catch by hand every time.

**Tests use the same doors as production code.** To exercise something internal, put a seam on that face and give it a second adapter, or drive it from outside through citysim. Test modules may relax lints locally with `#[allow]` on the test module; production code carries them as written.

## Language

| Where | Language |
|---|---|
| Identifiers, event names, error codes, rustdoc, commit subjects | English |
| `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/` | English, except `README.zh-CN.md` and `docs/getting-started.zh-CN.md` |
| Crate SPECs and design discussion | Chinese, with concept names kept in their English form |
| Pull requests, issues, review comments | **your own language.** Attaching a parallel translation — English if you wrote another language, Chinese if you wrote English — is welcome rather than required: with both side by side a reader is faster, and a mistranslation is visible instead of silent |

Comments are a failure signal by default. Four kinds earn their place: the MPL notice, public interface documentation, a warning about consequences, and a statement of intent the code cannot carry. In rustdoc, write what the signature cannot say — invariants, failure modes, call ordering, ownership.

## Commits

The first line is `card-<stage>.<index>: <what>`, for example `card-S4.02: the wire, and the two frames a socket cannot spell`. The body records **what you found**, since what you did is already in the diff: a gate that changed your design, a red-to-green transition that exposed a real defect, a choice between two approaches whose reason the result does not show.

A commit that touches anything in the `guard` row carries a `Verdict: user-approved` trailer. The wording of the ruling itself stays with the person; the trailer records that there was one.

## Where the authorities are

1. The person's ruling.
2. [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — structure: crate topology, seams, module map, shapes, determinism, verification.
3. `crates/<crate>/<crate>-SPEC.md` — that crate's interfaces and decisions, ahead of its code.
4. The code and its tests.

Where a lower level contradicts a higher one, the higher wins and the lower is corrected in the same change. Where reality contradicts all of them, reality wins and the document is corrected first, with its reason.

One directory named in `.gitignore` holds one machine's working notes. Nothing in this repository may depend on it, and `xtask release` refuses a document that sends a reader there.
