//! A set of real tasks, split into the part a change may learn from and
//! the part it may not.
//!
//! The split is the whole mechanism. A change that improves the tasks it
//! was built against has shown nothing; a change that also holds on the
//! tasks nobody looked at has shown something. So the two sets are
//! declared once, at construction, and a task that appears in both is
//! refused there — leakage is not a warning to read later, it is a suite
//! that cannot be built.
//!
//! `holdout` was going to be its own module. It is not, because it has
//! exactly one consumer and no state of its own: the split is a property
//! of the suite, and a second module would have been a second place to
//! ask which set a task is in.
