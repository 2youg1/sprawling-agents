//! What a settled asset is worth, from what it cost and what it was
//! used for.
//!
//! Assets are scored; agents are not. A run freezes and there is no "it"
//! left to keep a reputation for, so the thing that carries value across
//! sessions is what was written down — a document, a skill, a tool — and
//! that is what gets a number.
//!
//! The number is deliberately dull: uses against resident cost, in per
//! mille, with no weighting anyone has to defend. It exists to sort a
//! list so a person can look at the bottom of it. **It never decides
//! anything by itself** — deciding is `metabolism`'s, and adopting is a
//! mode's.
