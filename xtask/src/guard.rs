//! Guard gate: the gates guard themselves. A commit that changes gate
//! machinery (xtask/, lint config, CI, the justfile) or deletes a module-table
//! row **in the same commit as the source those gates judge** must carry a
//! `Verdict:` trailer quoting the user's ruling — this closes the "loosen the
//! gate to pass the gate" shortcut: fix the cause, not the gate.
//!
//! **A commit whose whole diff is gate machinery is a re-pricing, and
//! re-pricing is ordinary work** (AGENTS.md, `guard` row). The gate used to
//! demand a ruling for every touch of `xtask/`, which made changing the price
//! of a rule as expensive as breaking one — and that width is the recorded
//! mechanical reason the no-JavaScript rule outlived its argument by a year
//! (`docs/frontend-method.md` section 4). What is left is the one shape
//! nobody may take without a ruling: a gate loosened while carrying the work
//! it would otherwise have to pass.
//!
//! Scope: committed history only. The default is HEAD alone; CI passes
//! `--range`, which is `base..head` for a pull request and `before..after`
//! for a push, so a commit in the middle of a change-set is judged too and
//! not just the tip. Uncommitted edits are judged when they become commits
//! — gates testify about decidable objects only (xtask-SPEC.md section 3).
