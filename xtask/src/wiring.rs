//! Wiring gate: every verb on the wire is reachable from the side that is
//! supposed to reach it, and no other side pretends it is
//! (channels-SPEC.md section 19).
//!
//! **Both directions have failed here, and they fail differently.**
//!
//! Drawing a control the city cannot perform is loud: somebody clicks it
//! and gets a refusal. v0.0.3 shipped three of those - `Takeover`,
//! `Rollback` and `CreatePolicy` were on the wire, drawn in the client,
//! and executable by nothing - and `assembly::not_built` already carried
//! the rule in its own rustdoc: "A verb answered here must not appear as
//! a control in the client." Nothing was reading it.
//!
//! The other direction is silent, and that is what makes it worse. A
//! capability the city can perform and no control reaches produces no
//! complaint, because a button that does not exist is a button nobody
//! fails to press. `Pursue` - the whole of "the city keeps working until
//! the work runs out" - and `SetAutonomy` were both built, tested, and
//! unreachable from a browser. That is the mechanical reason v0.0.3's
//! second completion criterion was never accepted: you could not turn it
//! on.
//!
//! **Three sources, no copies.** The variants come from the real `enum
//! Command` parsed out of whichever `channels` module declares it; whether the city
//! can perform one comes from the arms of `assembly::run_command`;
//! whether a person can ask for one comes from `client/src`. The SPEC
//! contributes the one fact none of the three can state - which side is
//! *supposed* to reach it - and the gate reads it as data, so "the table
//! drifted" and "the enum grew silently" are the same red.
