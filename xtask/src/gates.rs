//! Run every gate in a fixed order and aggregate the findings. Order is
//! cheap-and-local first, git last; violations from all gates are rendered
//! together so a builder sees the full list, not the first stumble.
//!
//! The array below is the only authority for which gates run and in what
//! order; `COUNT` is its length parameter, one token away. `report` owns
//! what a run's outcome reads like and what it exits with.
