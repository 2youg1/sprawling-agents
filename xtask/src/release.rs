//! The published tree: what a reader outside this machine receives.
//!
//! The repository is the artefact. Every document that explains how this
//! is built - `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, each crate's SPEC - ships
//! with the code it explains, because a reader who wants to change the
//! code needs exactly those. **The isolation zone is the one exception**:
//! `local/` holds one machine's handoffs, rulings and probes, it is
//! gitignored, and nothing published may depend on it.
//!
//! Four assertions, all about honesty rather than tidiness. Nothing in
//! the published tree may be an isolation-zone path, nothing in it may
//! link to one - a link that is dead for every reader but one is a
//! sentence written for a reader who does not exist - nothing in it may
//! carry a path off the machine that built it, and nothing in it may
//! cite a document this tree does not contain.
//!
//! The fourth assertion exists because the third one missed a real case.
//! Six files - two settled screens, two SPECs and a gate's own rustdoc -
//! cited `WORKSPACE/FRONTEND-METHOD.md`, the directory this repository
//! happened to sit in on one machine. It is not a home path, so the
//! third assertion said nothing, and it is not a markdown link, so the
//! second said nothing either. A contributor who cloned this tree could
//! not read the document two gates named as their own justification.
//!
//! **A citation of a machine-local file is testimony that one of the two
//! is misfiled**, and the gate cannot decide which. Either the cited
//! document is an authority, and withholding it leaves a reader with
//! source and no reasons; or the citing text is one machine's working
//! note wearing a product file's name, and it belongs in the isolation
//! zone. The second reading is the one that gets missed, so the report
//! offers it first. It is not always available: the file that raised
//! this was `xtask/src/guard.rs`, a gate CI runs on every push, which
//! cannot move anywhere. There the testimony convicted the other side,
//! and the document it named now ships as `docs/frontend-method.md`.
