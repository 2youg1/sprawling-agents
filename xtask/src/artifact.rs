//! Artifact gate: nothing written for a test is compiled into the thing
//! a person downloads (the person's ruling, 2026-09-05).
//!
//! Two assertions, because test code reaches the binary two ways.
//!
//! **An item named for a test carries a `cfg` that keeps it out.** Four
//! of this repository's five conformance suites sit behind
//! `#[cfg(feature = "conformance")]`; the fifth, `browser`'s, was a plain
//! `pub fn` re-exported from `lib.rs`, and its own lint waiver called it
//! "dev-only by contract" while nothing held that contract. **A contract
//! with no holder is the defect this gate exists for** - it is invisible
//! in review precisely because the comment says the right thing.
//!
//! **The product binary enables no test feature.** The first assertion
//! is worthless if `sprawling` turns `conformance` on: the code would be
//! correctly marked and shipped anyway. `--all-features`, which
//! `just clippy` and `just test` both pass, is the build where every
//! suite must compile; the release build is the one where none of them
//! may exist.
//!
//! Judged by name rather than by content. A doc comment on a production
//! trait may name the suite that holds its adapters - `BrowserPort`'s
//! does - and a gate reading item bodies would convict the trait for
//! documenting itself.
