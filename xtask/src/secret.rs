//! Gate: no secret shape anywhere in the repository (C13). The judge is
//! `kernel::secret::scan` — one detector, one home; this gate only walks
//! and reports. Findings carry file + offset + length, never the bytes.
//! There is no inline waiver: a waiver comment would be a hole injected
//! content could drive through. Also enforces the `Sealed::expose` call
//! site whitelist ('s redemption points).
