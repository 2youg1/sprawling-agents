//! A11: how heavy is one session.
//!
//! **What this measures and what it does not.** A11 constrains how heavy we
//! build a session; it is not a threshold the runtime reads and not a
//! promise to a user. The server renders no interface, so the figure holds
//! no rendering context, no glyph bitmaps and no GPU textures; the browser's
//! own footprint belongs to the client machine and is not counted here.
//!
//! **One command, three platforms, rather than three scripts.** Three shell
//! scripts would be three authorities on what "resident" means, and the two
//! nobody runs today would be the two that are wrong tomorrow. Each platform
//! is asked in its own vocabulary, because the words genuinely differ:
//!
//! | platform | counter | why this one |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Linux | `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup` Pss | shared pages counted once, divided by their sharers - the honest reading when several Runs share one binary |
//! | macOS | `ps -o rss` | phys_footprint needs a private API; RSS over-reports shared pages and is therefore a conservative bound |
//! | Windows | `Get-Process` `WorkingSet64` | the private working set is what Task Manager shows and what an operator will compare against |
//!
//! The counters are not interchangeable, so the report names which one it
//! read. A number without its definition is how a budget quietly becomes
//! three different budgets.

use std::path::Path;
// Linux reads a file; the other two ask a program. The import carries the
// same condition as its only caller, or it is unused on Linux and the
// zero-warning build stops there.
