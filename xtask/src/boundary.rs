//! Boundary gate: which side of the process boundary a check stands on
//! decides the language it is written in.
//!
//! **White box is Rust, black box is Haskell** (the person's ruling,
//! 2026-09-05). A check that links these crates and enters by their
//! public faces is written in Rust beside the code it judges. A check
//! that reaches the product the way a stranger does - spawning the
//! binary, opening a socket to a served city, speaking the wire from
//! outside - is written in Haskell under `adversary/`.
//!
//! **The parameter that makes this a rule rather than a preference** is
//! what the two kinds of check are able to say. A Rust test shares the
//! product's types, so it inherits every assumption those types encode
//! and cannot testify about a client that does not. `adversary/` is a
//! third client, out of tree, in a language with none of this
//! repository's vocabulary, and what it buys is quantification over
//! traces rather than one trace somebody thought of
//! (ARCHITECTURE.md section 11, V10). A subprocess test written in Rust
//! is the worst of both: it pays the cost of a process boundary and
//! still inherits the assumptions, and it reports as a unit test.
//!
//! **What is measured is direction, not mechanism.** The first cut of
//! this gate looked for sockets and subprocesses in test code, and it
//! convicted `assembly::driving` three times over: that test stands up a
//! fake model provider and speaks HTTP to it, which is the test playing
//! **the outside world** rather than consuming this product. Three
//! waivers in one file is a gate saying its predicate is wrong, and the
//! honest reading is that `TcpStream::connect` says a socket exists
//! without saying which way it points.
//!
//! So the tokens below name the surfaces **this product raises** - its
//! binary and its server. A check reaching one of those is standing
//! outside, whatever else it does; a check that stands up a double and
//! talks to that is inside, however many sockets it opens. Under this
//! reading the whole tree needs no waiver at all.
//!
//! Scope is test code only. `runtime::tools::exec` spawns processes for
//! a living, `bin::wire_client` is a shipped WebSocket client, and
//! `channels::server` is the real `axum::serve`; the rule is about where
//! a *check* stands, never about what production code may call.
//!
//! A line may still be excused with `boundary-ok: <reason>` on itself or
//! on the line above, the same waiver `lexicon` uses and read the same
//! way. **A whole file that predates the rule goes in the register
//! instead**, because a waiver is permanent and a debt should remove
//! itself: a file the register names may cross, and a file it names that
//! has stopped crossing must be struck.
