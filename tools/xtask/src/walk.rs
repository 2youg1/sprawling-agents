/// holds none - `.gitignore` names every one of these. `.lake` is on the
/// list because the adversarial checker compiles beside its own source:
/// ninety-two generated files sit there after one build, and every
/// finding a scan reads out of them is a true statement about something
/// no reader will ever receive. A gate that reports generated files
/// reports nothing, because nobody reads past the first screen of them.
///
/// This list is a second authority for "what is in the tree", and git is
/// the first. It stays a list rather than a `.gitignore` reader because
/// four names cost four tokens and a parser costs a parser - but that is
/// the parameter: **the day this list needs a fifth entry that is not a
/// build directory, read the ignore file instead of adding a row.**
