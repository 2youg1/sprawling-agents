//! A thousand sessions, and what is left afterwards.
//!
//! The claim a long-running city makes is that freezing a run returns
//! everything it held. That is not a claim about speed, so it is not
//! tested by timing anything: it is a claim about what a handoff keeps
//! and what a resume asks for, and the way it fails is that one of them
//! grows with the number of sessions that came before.
//!
//! The invariant is therefore a shape, not a number: the thousandth
//! resume must ask for exactly what the first one did.
