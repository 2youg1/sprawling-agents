# ARCHITECTURE — sprawling

> It answers: what runs, what the stack is and what each choice costs, how the twelve units are wired, what happens end to end when you dispatch one piece of work, what is on disk, what crosses the wire, which parts you can replace, and how the whole thing is verified.

> It does not teach the vocabulary ([`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md)), install anything ([`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md)), or list the rules a change must satisfy ([`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
>
> **Two tables here are machine authorities**: the fenced `depmap` block in §3 and the module map in §12. `cargo xtask depmap` and `cargo xtask modmap` parse them, so an edge or a file that disagrees with them turns CI red. Their column shapes are fixed; the prose around them is not.

## 1 What runs

One process, one page. The client is Rust compiled to WebAssembly and embedded in the binary at build time, so no npm or node appears in the build chain. That is what this client is, not what a client must be: the wire in `crates/channels` is the seam, and a second client written against it in any language is a supported thing to build. The gate that once forbade JavaScript source in this tree was removed because it excluded architectures rather than defects.

## 2 The stack, and what each choice costs

The pinned versions live in `Cargo.toml`; this table says why each is there. Where a choice has a cost, the cost is stated rather than implied.

| Concern | Choice | Why it, and what it costs |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Rust, edition 2024, toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`, MSRV 1.97 | The invariants this design cares about are expressible as types, and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` holds workspace-wide. Cost: compile times, and a wasm client that has to be built before the binary that embeds it. |
| Async runtime | `tokio` 1, only in `channels` and the binary | The turn loop is synchronous on purpose — a decision that awaits is a decision that interleaves. Async stops at the process boundary. Cost: one blocking HTTP call per model request, paid inside a worker rather than a reactor. |
| HTTP server | `axum` 0.8 with its `ws` feature | It carries the WebSocket implementation itself, so the protocol has one version authority rather than two. |
| HTTP client | `reqwest` 0.13, blocking, `rustls`, no default features | One client for the whole workspace: providers and HTTP-reached MCP servers. Two clients would mean two TLS stacks in one binary. |
| Client | `dioxus` 0.7.10, `default-features = false`, `minimal` + `web`, built **without** `dx` | Rust to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` plus a pinned `wasm-bindgen` CLI. Dropping default features removes the `asset!` macro and devtools, both of which need the CLI we deliberately do not use. Cost: no hot reload; the CLI version must equal the crate version or the build breaks quietly. |
| History | JSONL segments, appended, chain-verified | A history a person can read with `tail` and a machine can verify byte by byte. Cost: the Ledger's throughput is the city's throughput (§11). |
| Cold views | `redb` 4.2 | Embedded, transactional, crash-safe. The projection is derived, so its file is disposable and never a second authority. |
| Content store | BLAKE3 (`blake3` 1.8) | One hash for the whole library: content addressing and `IdemKey` derivation. Identical content is stored once. |
| Restoration | `git2` 0.21, vendored libgit2 | Git is the restoration authority for tracked files, so a discarded file points at a checkpoint commit. Also one worktree per reviewing run. Cost: a C library in the tree, vendored so there is no system dependency. |
| Sandbox | `wasmtime` 48 + `wasmtime-wasi`, wasip1 only | Fuel-metered execution with **no socket host implementation** — the Python arm's mechanical proof that it cannot reach the network. Cost: an optional feature; a build without it refuses tool execution in three parts rather than pretending. |
| Credentials | `keyring` 3 (platform credential service), `secrecy` 0.10, `zeroize` 1.9 | Plaintext lives in the operating system's own vault, never in a file we wrote. `sha2` 0.10 is present for one external protocol fact: PKCE mandates SHA-256. |
| Entropy | `getrandom` 0.3 | OS entropy for the PKCE verifier and the login state. It is *not* the seeded RNG the simulator uses, and must never become it. |
| Serialisation | `serde` 1, `serde_json` 1, `toml` 0.8 | JSON on the wire and in the Ledger because the receiver may be a browser and a person still has to read it. TOML for configuration a person edits. |
| Errors | `thiserror` 2 | One error shape, `AxError`, defined in `kernel::error` and mapped at every crate boundary. |
| Release profile | `lto = "fat"`, one codegen unit, symbols stripped, `panic = "abort"` | Crash-only delivery: there is no unwinding path to maintain, because there is nothing to catch. |
| Dependency count | 497 packages in `Cargo.lock` | Listed by `sprawling status --deps`, licence-checked one by one by `cargo deny` against `deny.toml`. |

**Verification tools**, kept out of the shipped binary: `proptest` (properties before examples), `insta` (golden output), `trybuild` (proof that something cannot be expressed), `kani` (bounded proof, Linux CI), `cargo-mutants` (do the tests bite), `cargo-fuzz` (parsers against hostile bytes).

## 3 Twelve units and the dependency law

Crates are not a reuse mechanism here. They exist so that **the dependency rules are executed by the compiler**: the wall `pub(crate)` builds is drawn at the crate boundary, so twelve crates are twelve walls that actually close.

```
sprawling (bin: init/serve/resume/replay/fork/adopt/export/restore/status)
   ├─ runtime ──→ kernel, memory, gateway   turns, tools, sandbox, watchdog, fork
   ├─ collab  ──→ kernel, memory            inbox, drafts, workshop, fan-in, pull requests
   ├─ city    ──→ kernel                    space, residents, archive, library, schedule
   ├─ eval    ──→ kernel, memory            suites, probes, scoring, metabolism
   ├─ browser ──→ kernel                    WebDriver BiDi sessions, page snapshots
   ├─ protocol──→ kernel                    MCP outbound, ACP inbound
   ├─ memory  ──→ kernel                    Ledger, CAS, projections, attribution, git
   ├─ gateway ──→ kernel                    routing, dialects, market, cost, credentials
   ├─ channels──→ kernel                    Command/Query/Event, WebSocket server, auth
   └─ web     ──→ channels                  the one client, in a browser (wasm)
kernel: no internal dependencies.
```

The block below is what the machine reads. Actual edges must be a **subset** of it, so a hidden edge is a red build rather than a discovery:

```depmap
kernel:
memory: kernel
gateway: kernel
runtime: kernel, memory, gateway
collab: kernel, memory
city: kernel
eval: kernel, memory
browser: kernel
protocol: kernel
channels: kernel
web: channels
sprawling: kernel, memory, gateway, runtime, collab, city, eval, browser, protocol, channels
```

**Three rules.** Dependencies point inward, and never back. A seam declares its trait in the inner layer and implements it in the outer one, so `kernel` can define what a Ledger *is* without knowing where it is written. And splitting into crates buys compiler-enforced layering, not reuse — nothing here is published.

**Three kinds of edge**, and telling them apart is what makes the repository readable:

| Edge | When it exists | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency | compile time | `runtime → kernel` |
| Assembly | run time, only in `bin::assembly` | the upload sink in `channels::server` receiving `memory::cas` |
| Event | anywhere a `kernel::Ledger` handle is held | writing `tool_result` after a tool runs |

`runtime` has the widest fan-out — three crates at once. It may **use** their interfaces and nothing more; the moment a runtime module starts passing concrete types between `memory` and `gateway`, that edge moves up into the assembly layer.

`xtask` and `citysim` are workspace members outside the product graph. **citysim drives the turn loop a second time**: `runtime::run::drive` with simulated adapters — a scripted model, scripted tools, an in-memory Ledger — which is how one seed reproduces a run. It stops below `bin::assembly`, whose `RunWorker` builds its model adapter out of the endpoint book rather than receiving one; the dispatch policy above that line is held by that module's own tests. `sprawling` carries a lib target so the policy is at least *reachable* — an integration test enters by the same door `channels::server` uses — and inverting the model seam is what a seeded scenario would still need.

## 4 Seams

A seam is a trait declared in the inner layer and implemented outside it. **One adapter is a hypothetical seam; two make it real** — so every seam ships with a second implementation, and `cargo xtask depmap` refuses a `pub trait` declared anywhere but the files below.

| Seam | Declared in | Production adapter | Second adapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kernel::ledger` | crates/kernel/src/ledger.rs | memory: jsonl segments with tail recovery | citysim: in-memory Ledger |
| `kernel::tool` | crates/kernel/src/tool.rs | runtime tools, collab tools, browser, protocol | citysim: scripted tools |
| `kernel::model` | crates/kernel/src/model.rs | gateway: native and endpoint | citysim: scripted model |
| `runtime::sandbox` | crates/runtime/src/sandbox.rs | wasmtime with fuel metering | pass-through and fault doubles |
| `browser::port` | crates/browser/src/port.rs | WebDriver BiDi session layer | recording and replay adapter |
| `protocol::mcp` | crates/protocol/src/mcp/outbound.rs | stdio child process, or HTTP | `ScriptedOutbound` for offline replay |

**Two inner seams** stay `pub(crate)` because nothing outside their crate needs them: `memory`'s `Vfs` (real filesystem / deterministic power-loss model) and `gateway`'s `Vault` (platform credential service / in-session store).

**Deliberately not seams**: `gateway::dialect` is a pure function and needs no trait; the internals of `city`, `collab` and `eval` have one implementation each and are driven from outside by citysim; `git2` and `redb` are used directly, because an interface with one implementation is decoration.

## 5 One dispatch, end to end

This is the path everything else supports. Following it once explains more than any diagram of boxes.

1. **The page sends a Command.** A person fills in the control surface — address, what to produce, what counts as done — and `web::socket` sends `Command::Dispatch` over the WebSocket. The frame carries no budget: nobody can price a piece of work before it runs.
2. **`channels::server` decides whether to accept it.** Two pure judgements — may this address be bound, may this peer be accepted — with the socket code that surrounds them making no judgement at all.
3. **`bin::assembly` turns it into work.** This is the only place that samples the clock, so the timestamp enters as a parameter from here on. A worker takes the dispatch, and answers every refusal it can owe before it writes anything: the reserved subtree, a halted scope, rules that will not load, and a tag with no model behind it are all decided by `agree_to_work`, which reads and writes nothing. **Opening the room is the first thing this city puts on disk for a dispatch**, so work nobody could take leaves no room behind for a person to find.
4. **The city writes `run_started` before anything happens.** Every effect becomes an event first; that ordering is the design's load-bearing rule, not a logging preference.
5. **`runtime::prefix` assembles the frozen prefix** in four segments — city, building, resident, run — from `city::spine_files`, `city::policy` and `city::resident`. Assembling it is itself an event, and the result is frozen for the whole run.
6. **`runtime::catalog` decides what the model may see**: the three built-in tools, the collaboration tools this building admits, the skills its reading room allows, and any MCP tools discovered from the building's `CONFIG.toml`. `city::neighbourhood` is scanned in the same breath, so the run also knows which addresses it can reach and who stands at them — without it, `signal` takes an address the model has to have been told.
7. **`runtime::turn` enters its typestate**: Assembling → Calling → Applying → Settling, with four cancellation-safe points. An interruption inside a phase cannot be spelled.
8. **`gateway` makes the call.** `gateway::router` picks the endpoint attached to this tag; `gateway::dialect` translates the canonical Anthropic-shaped conversation into the provider's dialect; `gateway::credential` redeems a `secret:realm/name` reference into a header at the last moment; `gateway::admission` holds the provider's concurrency limit.
9. **The reply is scanned before it is recorded.** `runtime::redact` puts model output through the same secret scan as everything else, so a key a model repeated does not become permanent.
10. **Tools run behind gates.** `kernel::gate` answers with an exhaustive verdict — allowed, refused in three parts, or escalated to a person. `memory::checkpoint` puts a git fence before the wave and scans the worktree after it, so anything that disappeared becomes a `file_discarded` event carrying the way back.
11. **The result comes back shaped.** `runtime::pipeline` builds the result envelope — clock stamp, network reminder, any steer a person sent — and `runtime::compaction` shortens what is too long, always reporting how much it dropped.
12. **Everything lands in the Ledger, and the views follow.** `memory::hot`, `memory::projection` and `memory::attribution` fold the same event stream into what the pages ask for. The server pushes each event; `web::app` folds it into a `Snapshot`. The same fold, on both sides of the wire.

13. **A signal reaches whoever it names, working or not.** After the run freezes, each signal it sent is recorded and then delivered. A steer-kind signal slips under the door of a run that is already going, landing at that run's next safe point with `@` and the sender's address in front of it; anyone else who was spoken to is *knocked* — `bin::assembly` starts a run for them, whose brief names the resident who spoke. Only the person's own entrance can render as `user`, which is what makes an answer go to the right place. A knock addresses a resident, never a frozen run: history is read, not woken.

When the process dies mid-call, `sprawling resume` verifies the chain, closes tool calls whose outcome was lost as *unknown* rather than as failed, and reports what waits for a person.

## 6 On disk

A city is one directory. Copy it and it is the same city; delete it and nothing outside it changes.

```
<city>/
├─ .sprawling/                 the city's own reserved subtree
│  ├─ ledger/                  the only history — jsonl segments, appended, chain-verified
│  ├─ cas/                     content-addressed store, BLAKE3, one copy per content
│  ├─ views/                   redb: cold projections, disposable, rebuilt from the ledger
│  ├─ worktrees/               one git worktree per reviewing run, objects shared
│  ├─ staging/                 uploads land here read-only, never in a worktree
│  ├─ library/                 skills more than one building admits
│  └─ CONFIG.toml              city layer of the three-layer configuration
└─ <building>/                 one building, one line of business
   ├─ .sprawling/              the building's reserved subtree: what governs it (F2.09, F2.10)
   │  ├─ BUILDING.md           the building's rules: confidential, review, write domains
   │  ├─ CONFIG.toml           building layer, including its MCP servers
   │  └─ skills/               skills only this building admits
   ├─ Roadmap.md               the plan tree, and the denominator of every progress reading
   ├─ Memo.md                  decisions and corrections
   ├─ Handoff.md               what the next session needs
   └─ <room>/                  one session's workplace, named by the person who started it
      ├─ URBANITE.md           who this resident is and how it works
      └─ JOB.md                the task for this session
```

**One rule, applied at every scope: what governs a scope lives in that scope's `.sprawling/`, and no write domain reaches it.** `is_reserved` answers true for an address with `.sprawling` in any segment, so the check is one predicate in `kernel::address` rather than a list of protected file names. An agent therefore cannot edit its own accounting, its own configuration, its own building's rules, or the history of what it did.

A run's write domain is what its building's `BUILDING.md` declares, and **the whole building when it declares nothing** — which is the shipped template. The room is where a session works, not the boundary that contains it.

**`Roadmap.md` is a tree, and the `plan` tool is what writes it.** The index column is a path — `2.3.1` hangs under `2.3` — so one file states a multi-level plan without a second file to say how the levels relate. `Weight` is a ratio among the rows sharing a parent and `Needs` names what must finish first, which is what makes a ready set computable. A resident divides its own branch and cannot reach past it: `kernel::share` has no constructor, so a share exists only by dividing another one, and the total is the whole plan whatever the plan turns into. Only leaves are counted; a branch's work is its children.

## 7 The wire

One WebSocket, three kinds of frame, and a schema hash that both ends check on connect: a page from a different build refuses rather than misreads. `WIRE_V` is 13.

| Frame | Count | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `Command` | 23 | something a person wants done: dispatch, steer, cancel, approve, halt, raise a building, attach an endpoint, set a goal the city works towards |
| `Query` | 14 | something a page wants to know: the city, one run, approvals, cost, the ledger, archive, discards, inboxes |
| `Delta` | — | what a model is saying while it is still saying it: no sequence number, never written down, and a client that missed one has lost nothing |
| `Event` | the Ledger's own kinds | what happened, pushed as it happens |

Two properties are worth stating because they are enforced by types rather than by review. A `Command` carrying a credential **cannot be serialised**: `Sealed<T>` has no `Serialize`, and the `PutSecret` payload of the remote command type is an uninhabited type, so entering a key over the network is not a request that can be spelled. And every `Query` must be answered exhaustively — the answer match has no catch-all, so adding a query without answering it does not compile.

## 8 Parts you can replace

This repository bundles nobody's key, pays for nothing, and proxies nothing. Everything that reaches outside is therefore an adapter you can swap, and this section says where each one lives.

### Provider intelligence — followed from codex and pi

Signing in to a provider means knowing four things: authorization endpoint, token endpoint, client id, scopes. Those are facts, and they change without warning, so they are followed from two actively maintained projects rather than watched by hand: [`openai/codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex) (Apache-2.0) for OpenAI, [`earendil-works/pi`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) (MIT) for Anthropic and the rest. **What is followed is intelligence, not code** — see [`docs/third-party.md`](docs/third-party.md) for the obligations and how to re-check. That file's §3 also lists the thirty-one crates this workspace names and the licence each one declares; the full resolved graph is 413 packages and belongs to `cargo deny` and the CycloneDX bill of materials, not to a table in a document.

| To do this | Change this |
|---|---|
| add or correct a subscription provider | `gateway::oauth_profiles` — a table with data and zero branches |
| change how a login is begun, finished or renewed | `gateway::credential` |
| use an API key instead | the settings page: base URL, dialect, key |
| speak a third dialect | `gateway::dialect`, a pure two-way translation with the canonical shape in the middle |
| run a local model | `gateway::native` — local inference never goes through the outbound gateway |

**What you cannot move out**: credential custody. Plaintext reaches the platform credential service and nothing else, configuration holds a `secret:realm/name` reference, and that is part of what the product promises rather than an implementation detail.

### Outside applications — MCP, and Composio as one server among many

Mail, GitHub, Figma, Discord: writing an integration for each is a weekly chore unrelated to the problem here, so the whole class is outsourced over **MCP**. [Composio](https://composio.dev) is the first choice and is reached the same way any other server is — this code never knows what Composio is.

| To do this | Change this |
|---|---|
| give a building tools from a server | its `CONFIG.toml`: a `command` starts a child process, a `url` reaches a hosted server |
| point at a different provider of the same tools | the same URL field. Nothing else changes |
| add a transport | `bin::mcp_stdio` and `bin::mcp_http` are the two adapters behind `protocol::mcp`'s `Outbound` seam |
| drive this city from an editor | `protocol::acp` accepts an outside request as an ordinary dispatch |

A confidential building constructs none of them: data may enter and may not leave.

### The rest

| Part | Seam or surface | Note |
|---|---|---|
| execution sandbox | `runtime::sandbox` | implement the trait, pass its conformance suite; the shipped adapter is wasmtime with fuel |
| the client | `channels::wire` | the wire is the whole API; a second client writes against it |
| the browser driver | `browser::port` | frames in, replies out; the shipped adapter speaks WebDriver BiDi |
| where views are stored | `memory::projection` | delete the store and it rebuilds from the Ledger, byte-identical |

## 9 Seven shapes

Every module instantiates exactly one of these. The classification earns its place by what it catches: a module that cannot name its shape usually holds two things that want to be separate files.

| # | Shape | The test for it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | decision | no I/O, no clock, no global state; returns an exhaustive enum, never a bool |
| 2 | value | invariants enforced at one construction point; private fields; no setters |
| 3 | port | a trait on a seam, delivered with its conformance suite |
| 4 | adapter | thin, no policy: swapping in a second implementation changes no policy |
| 5 | typestate | phase changes enforced by types; no method returns a previous phase |
| 6 | data | data only, no branches. Editing it is editing behaviour |
| 7 | projection | folds the event stream into a view; deleting it and rebuilding gives the same bytes |

**The Humble Object is the recurring move**: the hard-to-test end is stripped to nothing and the thick end stays pure. `web::app`, `runtime::watchdog`, `gateway::endpoint`, `memory::projection` and the sandbox adapters are all instances of it.

### Making illegal states unrepresentable

Each of these is a type, not a slogan, and each has a compile-failure counterexample in the test suite — because "unrepresentable" is itself a claim that needs testing.

**These expectations are byte comparisons against a compiler's output, so the machine is part of them.** Installing the `rust-src` component makes rustc render a source snippet inside a `note:` that the committed `.stderr` files do not carry, and every counterexample using one goes red without a line of this repository changing. `cargo public-api` pulls that component in, so `just api-baseline` can turn `just check` red on the next run; remove it (`rustup component remove rust-src`) rather than blessing the longer output, which would only move the failure to CI.

- `EventRef` has no public constructor and no serde ⇒ **a forged event reference cannot be spelled**.
- `Completion::Done` always carries `Evidence`, and `Completion` has no serde ⇒ **a deserialised "finished" cannot be spelled**.
- A `Delegate` value has no `delegate` method ⇒ **a grand-delegate cannot be spelled**; delegation is one level deep.
- `Discard`'s constructor requires a `Restoration` ⇒ **a deletion with no way back cannot be spelled**.
- `Sealed<T>` has no `Serialize` ⇒ **entering a credential remotely cannot be spelled**.
- `UnplannedProgress` has no `ratio` method ⇒ **a percentage with no denominator cannot be drawn**; there is nothing to call.
- `Share` has no constructor and no arithmetic; the only producer is `Share::split`, which consumes what it divides ⇒ **weight cannot be minted**, so a branch cannot be given more than its parent had and the total is always the whole plan.
- `Held` has one private field and two consuming methods ⇒ **a claimed plan node cannot be put down silently**: it is finished with evidence or stopped with a cause, and a run that simply ends spends it on `FrozeWithoutEvidence`.
- `Pursuit::declare` takes the depth-zero position and a `Delegate` cannot produce one ⇒ **a sub-agent cannot set the city working until the work runs out**.

## 10 Determinism and hardening

The whole city runs as real code, single-threaded, seed-driven, on a virtual clock. That is not a testing convenience — it is the property that makes a failure reproducible from one seed, and these seven rules are its admission conditions.

| # | Rule | Held by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Decision paths iterate `BTreeMap`; never a hash order | review, plus the citysim determinism scenarios |
| 2 | Time arrives as a parameter; the one sampling point is `bin::assembly` | `clippy.toml` disallowed methods |
| 3 | One spawn point | review; the exception is runtime's concurrent wave, with structured cancellation |
| 4 | Seeded RNG handed out from one place | assembly derives per session |
| 5 | Execute in parallel, account in series, ordered by `seq` | the Ledger port owns `seq` and `prev` |
| 6 | Ledger payloads hold integers; timestamps are integer milliseconds; field order is declaration order | cross-OS byte fixtures |
| 7 | `IdemKey` derives from `(run, seq, normalised action)` — never from a clock or a random number | property tests |

Rules 1 and 6 together give a checkable property: **the same event sequence replays byte-for-byte identically on any machine.**

**Hardening** is compile-time, workspace-wide, and identical in tests and production except where a test module relaxes it locally: no `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!`, `unreachable!`, bare indexing or slicing; arithmetic is checked; narrowing goes through `TryFrom`; `as` casts are denied; `unsafe_code` is forbidden outright. Money and quantities are integer newtypes (`UsdMicros`, `Tokens`, `ByteLen`, `Seq`), and floats stay out of every decision path.

**The most fragile point in the design is one paragraph long.** A database handle, one `Instant::now()`, or a bare spawn inside `kernel` disables replay, formal verification and deterministic simulation at the same time. The gates hold that line so the property survives a builder who has never read this file.

## 11 How this is verified, and what it costs

Eleven layers, each catching what the layer above cannot. They deliberately do not overlap: overlapping verification reads as more coverage than it is.

| Layer | Catches | Today |
|---|---|---|
| V0 unrepresentable | a whole class of error moved out of what can be written | 15 compile-failure counterexamples |
| V1 types and lints | null, overflow, silent truncation, hidden panics | workspace lints, `-D warnings`, `--all-features` |
| V2 unit and property | a function wrong across a class of inputs | 1,085 tests, properties before examples |
| V3 conformance | a second adapter behaving unlike the first | one suite per port |
| V4 fuzz | parsers meeting hostile bytes | three targets: address, locator, truncated ledger tail |
| V5 formal | termination, absence of overflow, monotonicity | 3 of 11 kani harnesses, Linux CI — those with an unbounded domain and a solvable one |
| V6 deterministic simulation | components each correct and wrong together | citysim, six scenario files, failures reproduced from a seed |
| V7 mutation | tests that do not bite | `cargo-mutants`, by `just mutants` |
| V8 cross-version, cross-OS fixtures | byte drift after an upgrade or a platform change | golden ledgers in `fixtures/` |
| V9 end to end | the thing a person actually wants to do | the real client in a real browser against a real server, on a developer machine |
| V10 adversarial | a promise the door makes that holds on the traces we wrote and not on the ones we did not | `adversary/`, out of tree, in Haskell, driving the shipped binary over the wire |

**V10 is not a gate, and the difference is load-bearing.** Section 8 says the wire is the whole API and that a second client writes against it; `adversary/` exercises that permission by writing a third one outside the workspace, in another language, to attack rather than to use. It is reached by `just adversary` and by a schedule, never by `just check` — on a machine with no Haskell toolchain, `just check` behaves byte for byte as it does where the directory is absent, and `just adversary` prints one line and succeeds. What it buys that V2 cannot is quantification over traces: V2 proves that the paths we thought of hold, and V10 asks whether the door's stable error codes survive any prefix, one halt, and any suffix. It has already found three things a specific trace would not have — an exit code that means "no refusal arrived in time" where its own documentation promises "the city refused", a dispatch that writes a job file to disk before the guard that refuses it runs, and an `IdemKey` the wire makes every state-changing command carry that `kernel::gate::dedup` checks and nothing calls. All three are recorded in `adversary/adversary-SPEC.md` section 4; the second is fixed here (card V3.51), the other two are open.

**Four gaps, named rather than hidden.** CI has no browser driver, so V9 is a command a developer runs rather than a gate. The isometric city compares display lists rather than bitmaps: the preconditions for bitmap comparison are paid for — placement is a pure function of the id, painter order is total, projection and its inverse are exact — but there is no rasteriser. And V6 stops below `bin::assembly` (§3): a seeded scenario reproduces a run, not a dispatch, because `RunWorker` builds its model adapter instead of receiving one. What holds the dispatch policy is that module's own tests, plus the integration tests the lib target makes possible. And eight of the eleven kani harnesses are written but not proved, for two different reasons. Seven take concrete input, so each states what the `#[test]` beside it already states — twice over a wider domain — and those same seven build the `Vec`, `String` or `BTreeSet` whose loops CBMC cannot bound: they burned six hours, then forty-five minutes under a bounded unwind, and returned nothing either time. The eighth, `secret::entropy_is_total_on_short_inputs`, has a real domain but an unsolvable shape: some 2,560 symbolic non-linear multiplications, one per slot of a 256-slot count table times ten squarings inside `log2_q10`. CI proves the three that have both an unbounded domain and a tractable one, in under a minute each; closing either gap means rewriting a harness — symbolic without a heap collection, or over one slot rather than the table — rather than waiting longer (P4.05, P4.06).

### Four times a gate changed the design

Evidence that the mechanism pays for itself. In none of them was the gate loosened.

1. **The secret gate caught an `.expose()` on a boundary.** `ServeConfig` now takes a digest only, so `channels` cannot obtain the pairing token in plaintext at all — which also removed a length side channel.
2. **The secret gate caught a token's display form.** `PairingToken` now holds only a hash. Sealing a value and unsealing it on the next line is theatre; not holding it is the property that was wanted.
3. **The colour gate found a contradiction between two documents.** One set the brightest step at L=0.930 while a token table placed a hover variant at 0.945. The reading that makes both legal is that the bound delimits the greyscale information surface, and interactive variants sit above it by design.
4. **The public-surface gate caught "just one more `pub use` line" three times.** Re-exporting one item is a public-surface change, and to a builder it feels like it is not.

### The performance register

Sizes are gated because a byte count does not depend on how busy the machine was. Wall-clock figures are measured, reported with the machine that produced them, and never gated: a slow runner is not a defect, and a gate that says it is teaches people to ignore gates. The full register is `xtask/budgets.toml`; `cargo xtask budget` prints it.

| Metric | Budget | Measured | Gated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client bundle, gzipped | ≤2 MB | 558,419 B — 3.8× headroom | yes |
| The installed binary | ≤128 MB | 8,620,032 B, client included | yes |
| Resident memory, one session | ≤30 MB | 4.3 MB idle, 7.8 MB running a real run | no: the counter means something different on each platform |
| Ledger append plus fsync | p50 ≤5 ms, p99 ≤20 ms | 0.97 ms / 1.61 ms on one NVMe machine | no |
| Projection rebuild | ≥50,000 records/s | about 493,000 records/s on the same machine | no |
| Prefix assembly | ≤1 ms | 0.022 ms for 16.5 KB over four slots | no |
| Resident segment, catalog included | none stated | 815 B on one real dispatch, with thirteen tools admitted | no: what a building admits is the building's, and a reading room with more in it is not a defect |
| Kernel mutation score | ≥90% | by `just mutants` | by that command, not by `just check` |

The two size rows are also rendered as the badges in `README.md`, from this same reading — `cargo xtask badge --write`, which `just dist` ends with. Nobody types a size into a document.

**One honest trade.** With network and model time removed, the throughput ceiling of a city is the throughput ceiling of its Ledger. That is the price of "the Ledger is the only history", stated in the open. The first five walls, in the order they are reached: provider-side rate limits (a few dozen concurrent calls), Ledger fsync, worktree disk, file-descriptor limits, then the blocking pool. RAM is not among them.

## 12 Module map

The machine's data face, parsed by `cargo xtask modmap`: a `.rs` file under `crates/*/src` that is not in this table turns CI red, and so does a row whose file is missing. `lib.rs` and pure index files are exempt because they hold no logic — that too is checked.

Columns are fixed: **Module | File | What it owns | Shape** (§9) **| Since** (the construction stage that introduced it: S0–S5 skeleton, P1–P4 product, R1 repair, F1 front end, P5–P7 documents, measurement and delivery) **| Status** (`planned`, `building`, `built`, `frozen`).

## 13 Changing this document

- **Structure is add-only.** The topology in §3, the seam list in §4, the shape set in §9 and the module map's column contract change only with an explicit ruling, recorded in the commit that changes them.
- **A rejected alternative is recorded where the decision lives**, in the crate's SPEC, rather than in a separate register of regrets.
- **Adding a module row is the registration step**: the row lands in the same change as the file, before it is written.
- **Removing a module row requires a ruling** — `cargo xtask guard` refuses the commit otherwise, because a row that quietly disappears is a rule that quietly stops being enforced.
